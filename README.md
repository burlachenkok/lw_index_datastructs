# README #

Collection of rather low level primitives to have some popular index datastructures suitable for work with vectors in R^n

* KD trees

# How to build and use

[1] Install Python 3.* interpreter into the system, Git any version, CMake 10.* or higher

[2] Install standard toolchain in your system: GCC in Linux OS and one of the versions of Visual Studio in Windows OS into Standart Paths

[3] After all 1-3 steps, you should use a single script which you should use: "lw_index_datastructs/scripts/project_scripts.py". It can be used:

* Show help
* To generate project files (-g)
* Build from cmdline (-r)
* Launch unit tests (-t)

[4] Generated project files are availabe in "out"

[5] If in Windows OS you use Visual Studio the used version of Visual Studio is hardcoded in config_build.py and currently is specified for Visual Studio 2019

[6] To launch unit-scripts on your target platform use *"project_scripts -t"* command line.
